# Welcome to Honor's Blog

### Feb. 5, 2020
I set up this GitHub Page to use as my blog. I need to do some more testing before setting up a page for everyone. I hope to be able to create a template for people to use for their blog posts. I also hope to not have every post be in this single markdown file.
