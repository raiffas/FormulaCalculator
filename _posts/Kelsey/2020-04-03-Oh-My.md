As I write this post, I am writing it in my graduation cap and gown. 35 days until graduation: this is my motivation for rolling out my user stories!

Our team is currently wrapping up sprint 2 and looking to plan for sprint 3 this weekend. Last sprint was a rough one for our team; it was a short sprint and our team had difficulties being as productive as we usually are for a sprint due to the shortness of the period, as well as disruptions to our lives from the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, we have been experiencing issues merging our code together; we have mostly hashed out the issues, except for one test that is still failing after merge for our function that generates the pdf. Hopefully, we will be able to solve this issue before sprint 3 planning this weekend. 

Our team has been incredibly supportive and understanding of each other during this chaotic time. I am so proud of my team's compassion towards one another, and just proud in general of our work ethic and collaboration skills. 

It's hard to believe that we're already looking to plan for the last sprint of the semester. Working on this project has definitely helped contribute to my team collaboration skills, as well as sharpen my practical knowledge on the software development process. 

I am so grateful that I have had the opportunity to pursue a bachelors in Computer Science at the University of Kentucky; from the theoretical computer science foundational principles I have acquired in class, to taking advantage of undergraduate research opportunities offered by Computer Science professors and utilizing our extensive alumni network, I feel that the University of Kentucky has prepared me to enter the workforce and build a career as a successful software developer, and the knowledge I have gained about different software development technologies and working in a team during this project has contributed to that. 

Just one more sprint, and I'll be one more step towards officially graduating with my degree!
