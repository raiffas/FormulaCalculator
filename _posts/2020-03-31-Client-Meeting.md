### Project Progress
This meeting occurred on the last day of the sprint 2. At this point, most of what code was getting done this sprint had been done, though there is still some coding to be done by some people. Everyone reported to Mike about the progress they made on the code. Overall, everyone seemed to feel like they have made good progress on getting the code towards the planned goal. Only a small challenge was expressed by Tyler about part of the code for solving equations, but he stated that he has a plan to address it.

### Questions Answered
No questions were planned going into the meeting. Likewise, there were almost no questions asked from the team. Cameron inquired about potentially acquiring more PDFs to test, since he was making progress faster than he expected. Mike mentioned that this was possible, due to the federal crash database he has access to.

### Main Topic: Encouragement from Mike
Mike continued to seem enthused by the progress we are making on the project. He took a minute to reiterate that he appreciates our effort on the project. He also stated that he does not expect the code to be complete for what he has planned (he expects that this will take more than a year) but the fact the we are making excellent progress is exciting. He concluded by stating that we should be emphasizing is building a good framework for the code so future teams can work on it.
