## Sprint 2 Retrospective

We finished officially sprint 2 a few days previously but did not have time at that meeting to do any retrospective. In addition, we reorganized the file structure, which caused many issues in Git when merging. It took a few days, but we eventually worked it out. 

The primary concern on our sprint 1 retrospective was a lack of communication between partners and the team as a whole. This sprint, we spread a couple stand-ups throughout the sprint that worked fantastically to keep us on track. The team did a much better job this sprint communicating and keeping each other in the loop. Personally, I think it really increased efficiency.

A concern found in our sprint 1 retrospective was reiterated in this retrospective. It appears that our original estimation of story points was yet again inaccurate. However, we recognize that 100% accuracy is in truth impossible. In the future, we will attempt to be more flexible when it comes to story points.

## Sprint 3 Planning

Sprint 3 is the last of our planned sprints. Happily, most of our user stories are complete. Several team members are continuing epics that they began in sprint 2. Other team members are picking up the miscellaneous stories that are necessary and unfinished. Overally, the team is optimistic. We believe that we can deliver an appropriate product to our customer by the deadline. Yes, there are certainly some stretch goals, but we think Mike Flamm with be happy with our progress when we inform him at the next client meeting this Tuesday.
