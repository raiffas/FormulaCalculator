title: Sprint 1 Retrospective

Due to the situation with Covid-19 and Spring Break, the team started sprint 2 a few days late. Our retrospective of sprint 1 was very good. I think it brought up a lot of good ideas, but there were two things that stood out.

First, sometimes estimates of story points are inaccurate. For this sprint, Tyler and I both thought that our chosen user stories overestimated their points while everyone else thought their stories had been severly underestimated. Now in our sprint planning meetings as we decide on user stories for that sprint, we consider if our recent experience with the project allows for a better assessment of tast difficulty.

Second, we need to communicate as a team better. Each small team of two did communicate some but all stories are interconnected. There were some areas in which team members had problems and questions, but we did not immediately ask the appropropriate member. Also, there were a few items that would require all team members to agree on convention. Instead of speaking up, we wasted time applying what we thought would be okay then had to go back and change some things afterwards. As sprint 2 begins, I hope we can change our behavior to correct these types of issues.
