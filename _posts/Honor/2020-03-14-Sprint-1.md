The team is in the middle of sprint one right now. I am working on two user stories for data processing while Tyler is doing some user stories to prepare for the next processing user stories. We're sort of a team for data processing.
My stories are related to a couple of the minimum application requirements finding times of interest to the user. Tyler is preparing for the interative aspect of our equation solving.

Related to user stories, I noticed that there's some overlap in stories. For instance, there are two stories that get to the same answer but the answer has two different parts and the different user stories return one part or the other. Yet these stories were taken by two different team members. The team needs to pay attention to such things at the next sprint planning meeting.
