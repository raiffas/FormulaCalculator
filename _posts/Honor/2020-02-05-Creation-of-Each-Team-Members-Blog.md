title: "Creation of Each Team Member's Blog"
Honor: Honor

I used GitHub Pages and Jekyll to create a blog page for each member of the team. Each page is accessible by way of a link on the project homepage.

For a member to have a blog page, there must be a:
1. page layout html file defined in the \_layout folder
2. page creation markdown file in the gh-pages folder

To create a new post, use the template provided in the \_posts\ folder. Follow instructions in template.

Each blog page currently prints a bullet-point list of all blog posts for that person. Each point prints the post date, title, and contents.

Credit to GitHub user 'hypraptive' repository 'hypraptive.github.io' for an example of how GitHub pages and Jekyll work together to create blog posts.
