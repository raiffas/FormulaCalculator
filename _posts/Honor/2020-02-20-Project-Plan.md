The team met on Sunday, Feb. 16, to write requirements for the Requirement Specifications document and divvy up parts to each team member. 

I took notes during the meeting. I was part of the team writing non-functional requirements for the Requirement Specification document. I also wrote the Requirement Specification Introduction section and the System Model section. I worked a bit with Raiffa on Appendix B, the equation section.

Lastly, I convinced the team to allow the Requirement Specification document to be transferred into LaTeX! LaTeX creates documents so much more clean and organized than Google Docs, which we were using before then. I taught Raiffa some LaTeX essentials then we put the document in and reformatted.
