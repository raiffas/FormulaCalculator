## Stand Up Meeting with Mike
During this client meeting, we updated Mike on progress of the code and demonstrated the current version of the overall system to him. Kyra demonstrated the current `main.py` script, which serves as the base for the completely integrated system. In addition, Cameron demonstrated how the system extracts tables from the given PDF and returns them as Pandas DataFrames which can be manipulated as need throughout the rest of the code.

## Questions Answered for Mike
Mike asked about how well the system can handle variations in headers for the PDF extraction step. Kyra confirmed that the current implementation cannot handle that, but could easily be added by a future team.

Mike asked about the status of the equation solver. Tyler confirmed that it is a work in progress. He will try to get it to a point to where it can be demonstrated, but whether that is possible will depend on how much of the code he can complete and get tested.
