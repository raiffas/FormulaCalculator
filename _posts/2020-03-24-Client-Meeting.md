### Project Progress
This meeting occurred at the close of sprint 1, and was our first client meeting with Mike after we began actually programming for the project. Now that we all had code written, we all reported to Mike what we all had accomplished during sprint 1, describing our individual contributions to the code "stand up meeting" style.

### Questions Answered
Honor asked Mike a question about determining the end of a crash pulse. According to the meeting notes, Mike said, "If at the end of a 20ms period, there has been no single time with greater than 0.5 difference compared to the beginning of the 20ms, the crash pulse is considered ended."

Tyler asked the meaning of a variable on the equation sheet. According to the meeting notes, "Variable on number 6 [of the] equation sheet [is] ‘speed at impact,’" which is when the vehicle hits another object.

Mike told us that we need to be aware of how many vehicles might be needed for certain equations, and that all equations should be independent of frame of reference.

### Main Topic: Encouragement from Mike
The team discussed with Mike the ramifications of COVID-19's impact on classes: the team will be working remotely for the rest of the semester. However, the team plans to get just as much work accomplished as if we were working together in person. 

Mike took a minute to tell the team how he appreciates our efforts on the project and is really proud of our progress; he says he's impressed with our progress. Go Team A!

### Takeaways
Mike will get CDR Reports to us this evening. Sprint planning directly following this meeting.
