### Project Progress
We began the meeting by explaining our work on the Architecture Assignment to Mike and recapping the Sprint Planning meeting we had on Sunday.

We then sent our user-stories document to Mike for him to look over.

### Main Topic: Sprint #1
Mike let us know of a potential stretch goal for the project involving calculations regarding a vechicle's weight. He let us know that Susan already has mocked-up the UI, and that it requires integration with an existing database. After brief discussion, we decided to table the topic for a few weeks before we decide if it will be incorporated into a future sprint.

We also requested CDR reports from Mike from the 3 main car companies listed in the specification by the end of the week.

### Takeaways
Next week, those who will not be able to attend the meeting should contact Mike in advance with anything they need from him. Today begins coding for Sprint #1!
