The team met today to work on and discuss the Project Plan assignment due tomorrow. I wrote the Target Environments section, Risk Management and set the priorities for each functional and non-functional requirement. Overall, I think this team has a lot of potential and I am excited to see what we end up with this semester.

I believe most of the work with this project will be finding an effective way to read the data from the tables and to ensure that the data is correct. Once this is set, I believe the rest will fall into place.
