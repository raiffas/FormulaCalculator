### Timeline
The past few weeks have been strange since the outbreak of the coronavirus in the U.S. and our daily lives have changed significantly. As of right now, all of our classes have moved online and even my intern-position at CSI has moved to VPN only. Amongst everything that is going on I try to stay positive and find time to go outside and get some fresh air whenever I can.
Today the team is merging their code from Sprint 2 together, but I am behind on writing my test cases because I have a Calculus 4 Quiz today and Test tomorrow. But honestly, if I managed my time better, I should have had my code done by today.
