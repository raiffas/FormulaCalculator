### Recent Events
I registered for my classes next semester which will be my last semester at UK. It's really exciting to finally graduate and at the same time a bit scary to realize that everything is going to change. I'm hoping that there will be a job for me at CSI when December rolls around, but with the Coronavirus, it might be a bit of a stretch if things don't start getting better soon. I think the 20th makes about a month since I've left the house to actually go anywhere besides on a walk.

This past week I haven't been able to work on the project that much. I had another project due Tuesday that I didn't get done until yesterday and I have a quiz today in another class. So it looks like most of the work for the rest of the srpint will have to be done Saturday so that Sunday we can clean up the code and prepare for the coding assignment next Tuesday.

After this week there is only about 3 weeks of class left.
