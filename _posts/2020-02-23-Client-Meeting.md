We set up this meeting for Mike to walk us through the though process a user might take if they didn't have access to our application. Only Kyra and Honor attended the meeting over Zoom. The others were unavailable due to things like illness and family obligations. Honor recorded the meeting and uploaded it to the Team Drive.
