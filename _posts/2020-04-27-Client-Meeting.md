### Stand Up Meeting with Mike
During this client meeting, we touched base with Mike after presenting our final project. Mike said that everyone did a wonderful job and is very pleased will all of the work we completed this semester. He asked if anyone is interested in helping him with another project over the summer using C++ and QT. Cameron and Raiffa were the only ones to express interest and are going to meet up with Mike at a later date for more details on that. 

### Conclusion
The team agreed that the project was a lot of fun and thanked Mike for being easy to work with and quick to respond to all of our questions.
