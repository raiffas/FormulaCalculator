## Project Status Meeting
Today we had our Project Status meeting with Dr. Hayes. Each of us gave a brief summary of what we had accomplished in the past 7 days, including our goals, accomplishments, and shortcomings for Sprint 2. We then gave an overview of what we hoped to accomplish in the next 7 days as a part of Sprint 3. If there were any blockers, we addressed them or gave updates on previously mentioned blockers. We also discussed upcoming deadlines with Dr. Hayes and the logistics behind the upcoming Coding Presentation.


## Weekly Stand-Up
After our meeting with Dr. Hayes, we each elaborated on our progress so far in Sprint 3. We addressed new frameworks or methods we were planning on introducing, such as Tyler suggesting the use of YAML. We also asked any lingering questions to our fellow teammates. Currently, we plan to have our code wrapped up by April 19th to allow those presenting in the Code Presentation to be prepared a few days beforehand.
