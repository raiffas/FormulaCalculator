### Stand Up
This meeting was scheduled for the team to record our presentation for our finished application tomorrow, Tuesday the 28th. 
A few members had some issues with microphones and a power outage, so it was decided that it would be easier to record each of our parts separately and then piece them together. Raiffa offered to stitch each separate audio recording together over top of the presentation slides.

Our last meeting with Mike and as a team, will be tomorrow at 6:00 pm EST.
