Today, we meet with Mike about our requirements. The only problem he saw was that there was no mentioning of lateral data in the requirements. From how he explained it, it now seems obvious that this data needs to be taken into consideration just like the longitudinal data. I was also able to talk with Mike more about the users for the end product. To put in briefly, someone with a high school diploma should be able to use this piece of software. So, we need to focus on low-technical users. This should help with designing it, though it does seem to push the need for a GUI for this project. Mike has stated that his wife Susan can help us with the UI components if need be, so that could be beneficial.

We are planning an extra meeting for Sunday with Mike so he can show us how he does the calculations by hand. I plan on being their, but hopefully we can record it as well in case I can't.
