Today, we discussed the formulation of the project plan. This needs to be done by the 18th, so we've decided to split up the work into parts. Some sections of it, such as the requirements, need to be created as a group. We therefore decided to pick parts which could be done individually. I decided to deal with business requirements and the metrics.

We discussed today about how the system overall would look. We've come up with a rough model for how the system. Generally speaking, the system has three components: User input, PDF extraction, and formula solving. The below image captures the rough flow of it.
