Since we started the sprint Tuesday, there isn't a lot of time to work on the user I selected, which involves implementing the equation solving part of the system. This is an epic, so that's not surprising. I plan on completing some ancillary parts of the system first. This includes creating/updating a constants file, defining how vehicle information comes in from the crash data package, etc. In the meantime, I hope to have enough time to plan out how the actual equation solving code will look like. I've gotten some of it done already, but I'll spend the weekend finishing out what I can.  I also hope to write the tests for it then as well.
