A recap of the meeting held on Sunday, Februrary 9th

#### Team Meeting 

Group A - Let the Computer Decide met on 2/9/20 to complete the User Stories group assignment and discuss next steps following our first client meeting. We also decided on takeaways that should be completed (or at least contemplated) before the next class on Tuesday, February 11th.

#### User Stories Assignment

After reviewing the minutes and agenda from our first client meeting, we had a general discussion of what we felt the users of the project would do and who they would be. Then, we broke up into groups of two, each group working on a user story and acceptance criteria. I paired up with Tyler, and we discussed the data processing needs of the application and what a user could expect when it came to calculating the crash analytics results.

#### Project Plan Assignment

After completing and turning in the User Stories Assignment, we looked at the requirements for the Project Plan assignment and broke up when the work would be completed.

#### Takeaways

We decided on the following takeaways to be considered or completed before the next class:
* Completing the when-is-good form for a weekly meeting with Mike
* Compiling a list of all possible user actions or user needs
* Familiarizing ourselves with the components of the Requirements Specification Document
* Completing our Developer Notes blog entries
