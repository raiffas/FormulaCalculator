A recap of the meeting held on Tuesday, April 7th and Sprint #3.

#### Team Meeting
On Tuesday, our group met for our weekly stand-up meeting with our client, Mike from Delta V Innovations. This was the start of a new sprint, so we discussed the end of Sprint #2 and what we had accomplished, as well as what we hoped to accomplish as a part of Sprint #3. We also instructed Mike on how to download our code and run it so far, updating the usage and README as necessary. He seemed to enjoy our test documents and commit comments :)


#### Sprint #3 Development
For Sprint #3, I chose to continue my two previous user stories. My user story in Maintenance that served functionally as creating a main module, was in actuality an epic that needs improvement and changing with every other implementation made by the team. As a result, I needed to continue working on the main this sprint, incorporating changes made in the last and current sprints. I also needed to continue implementing my graphing via MatPlotLib as it needs to be given data and tested within the main as well.

In this meeting, we also discussed the need to finish up our formal testing documentation, and plans to begin acceptance testing. We went over the requirements for the Coding Assignment, and made sure that we had plans to cover all of the points required.
