A recap of the meetings held on Sunday, Februrary 23rd

## Team Meeting
On Sunday, Honor and I met with our client, Mike Flamm, to discuss the step-by-step process a crash analyst takes when working on a case. The meeting was recorded by Honor, and I took notes for the other teammates to review.

### Summary
During the meeting, Mike provided us the data from one car involved in a two car crash. He walked us through each page of the data, explaining what he sees as most important when he is working a crash. He also showed us the relevant equations used on each of the data points and how to find which of the many time-stamped values to use. Finally, he showed us the eventual product of our calculations - a crash scene reconstruction. He even used real-life examples to show how these reconstructions can be vital to criminal cases.

### Takeaways
Here are the most important takeaways from our meeting:
* The bare bones of what Mike wants in this application are:
  * Can we read in the accelerometer data?
  * Can we identify the delta v's for the maximum lateral AND maximum longitudinal points in time?
  * Can we calculate the total delta v for every point in time?
  * Can we display data in both g's and mph?
