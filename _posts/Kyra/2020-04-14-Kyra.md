A recap of the meeting held on Tuesday, April 14th and Sprint #3.

#### Team Meeting
On Tuesday, our group met for a brief Stand-Up Meeting to discuss our progress for Sprint #3 and the Coding Assignment due in one week. We decided to have our code finished by this Sunday in order to allow time for polishing. We also had our weekly stand-up meeting with our client, Mike, where we discussed our progress on the last week of Sprint #3.

#### Sprint #3 Development Continued
As previously discussed, my user stories for this sprint were those extended from last sprint. This week, I worked primarily on the flow of data within the main, ensuring that each class was set up to get the data it needed and pass its results onto the next step. This required some retooling of methods in the data_preprocessing class and the equation_solver class.
