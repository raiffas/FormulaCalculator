A recap of the meeting held on Sunday, Februrary 16th

Group A - Let the Computer Decide met on 2/16/20 and 2/17/20 to complete the Project Plan group assignment.

After meeting on Sunday, I also was assigned the Conclusion and descriptive paragraph for the Non-Functional requirements. As a group, I contributed to the System Model and the Non-Functional Requirements.

The major design decisions for this section begin with the categorization of our system's users. After speaking with Mike, our customer, he described the users of our system as having varying levels of expertise. In his mind, users of the system either have training and experience in doing crash analytics by hand or they have no training whatsoever. Based on this dichotomy, I decided to split our users into crash analysts, or unexperienced users who want to receive automated crash analytics results, and system administrators, or experienced users who want to add to the available equations and coefficients in the system.

In order to determine the use cases for each of these users, I made a list of all necessary user actions, and any user actions necessary to make a maintainable and user friendly application.

We decided on the following takeaways to be considered or completed before the next class:
