### Stand Up
This meeting was scheduled for everyone to report on their progress made for Sprint 2. Most everyone seemed to have completed the work they set out for themselves, except for one or two people who still need to write test cases. Sprint 2 is supposed to end today but we are pushing back merging code and Sprint 3 planning to Thursday, April 2nd.

### Questions Answered
Kyra asked Honor and Tyler if the equationsolver/datapreprocessor is expected to be ran automatically or will it be called in main - They will probably be called in main.
No further questions.

### Takeaways
* Source Code needs to be organized
* Meeting with Mike at 6 tonight
