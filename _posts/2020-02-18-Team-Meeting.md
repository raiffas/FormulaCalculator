Meeting with Mike went well. The team had a few more questions about the users that would be interfacing with the application and asked for an example of an accelerometer crash report. We learned that there will be high-level and low-level users for this application so we need to make something that is easy to use for all, but is also not too granular. We will be meeting with Mike on Sunday, Februrary 23rd at 2:00 pm to get a better understanding of how the formulas work together and to find out more about how he invisions this application.
