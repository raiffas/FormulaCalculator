This was our team's first meeting after Spring Break and since starting our first sprint! We did a quick stand up as it had been a while since the team had communicated, discussed some design issues we ran into, and set dates for our next sprint planning meeting and a weekly standup. 

### Stand Up
As half of this sprint was during spring break, a lot of us were behind on this sprint. We expected this and we're adding a couple extra days to our sprint to allow everyone enough time to finish up their user stories. In addition, the majority of us ran into issues with the overall design of the application and how their specific piece plugged in. In order to solve this problem, Tyler and I are working on refactoring our detailed class design and diagram to integrate a data object that standardizes information passed through the different pieces of the app. In addition we will be intoducing a main.py that seves as the main controller for the application. 

### Planning for the future
Since we will not be seeing each other as regularly as before, we are planning on holding a weekly team stand up to quickly discuss our progress and any issues we are facing. We are currently planning on holding these after our stand up with Dr. Hayes.
