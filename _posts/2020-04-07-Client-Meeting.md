## Stand Up Meeting with Mike

During this client meeting, we touched base with Mike on our project progress. We discussed our plans for the coming week to begin wrapping up code changes. 

The team agreed the current goal is to make sure that what our code does now, it does correctly. 

## Questions Answered for Mike

Mike asked if we were going to be able to finish all the user stories we had written. The team agreed that we would not be able to finish the user stories we considered as "stretch goals," but that we will have a barebones deliverable by the end of the semester. 

Mike asked about current run time of the program; the program takes about 8 seconds to parse information from the pdf, which will probably be the more than other parts of the app workflow. Mike agreed this was an acceptable time. 

Mike asked about the program's ability to detect more than one dataset in a given pdf. The team plans to work on this, but this feature is not currently implemented.

Mike also asked if we needed any more resources to finish up the code, to which the team agreed not at this time. 

Mike expressed interest in cloning the code and running it himself. Kyra fixed the docs on Github so he would have instructions on how to do that.
