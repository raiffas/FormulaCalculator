title: End of First Sprint
Raiffa: Raiffa
---

Welcome to Raiffa's developer blog!
The past few weeks have been a whirlwind of requirements, client meetings, and CS499 assignments all leading up to
the our first sprint (which starts in a little less than a week!).

As a whole, the first part of our project development has gone fairly well. Our team is staying well organized and focused. In addition, our customer has been very accommodating with our schedules and incredibly helpful in helping us understand his work. 

Before our sprint begins, we still have the architecture assignment to complete. Once this is done, we will be able to split up into smaller teams to tackle the bulk of our project--the programming.
